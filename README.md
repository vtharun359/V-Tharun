Short answers to the Interview Questions

1. What is Git and why use it? Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code. Use it to collaborate, maintain history, create branches, and roll back changes.

2. How do you push code to GitHub? git add, git commit, then git push origin <branch>.

3. What is GitHub Pages? A free service from GitHub to serve static websites directly from a repository.

4. Difference between static and dynamic websites? Static sites serve fixed files (HTML/CSS/JS). Dynamic sites generate HTML on the server (or client) based on logic, data, or user input.

5. How do you revert commits in Git? Use git revert <commit> to make a new commit that undoes changes, or git reset --hard <commit> (careful: rewrites history).

6. What is branching in Git? Branching creates independent lines of development so multiple features/bugs can be worked on without affecting main.

7. Explain pull requests. A PR asks to merge changes from one branch into another and supports code review, discussion, and CI checks.

8. How to resolve merge conflicts? Open the conflicted files, edit the conflict markers <<<<<<, choose the correct code, then git add and git commit.

9. How to host a website for free? Use GitHub Pages, Netlify (free tier), Vercel (free tier), or other static hosts.

10. What is continuous deployment? Automatically deploying code changes (usually after tests pass) to production whenever changes are merged.

Submission checklist (what to paste into the task submission link)

Public repo URL: https://github.com/<yourusername>/<yourusername>.github.io

Live site URL: https://<yourusername>.github.io

Short note in the submission: "Completed Task 5 — GitHub Pages deployment. Repo and live site above."

If you want, I can:

Generate a slightly fancier one-page template (portfolio with sections and icons),

Produce screenshots you can include in the repo,

Or generate a ready-to-copy README.md that fits the task description precisely.

Tell me which one and I'll drop it into this document.
